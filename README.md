Nothing lasts forever ‚Äì even the insights from your last survey go stale after a while. One way to keep your survey results fresh and actionable is by running your survey again and creating a multi wave tracking study, also known as tracker or tracking survey. 

A tracking survey is a survey that asks the same questions across an interval of time, which allows you to ‚Äútrack‚Äù the changes from one deployment to the next and find trends over a certain period.

Each time you send your survey, whether it‚Äôs annually, quarterly, or more frequently is called a ‚Äúwave.‚Äù Comparing survey results across waves will show trends and changing attitudes that can either prove your decisions are solid or indicate it‚Äôs time to change course.
